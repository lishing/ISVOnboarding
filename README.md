# ISV Onboarding - An Introduction
</br>
My passion is to work with ISVs. Throughout my conversations in the past 1 year, I consolidated these resources from the valuable conversations with ISVs. This is a repository of public resources that most ISVs would use. I had divided it into 4 sections:
1. How you can get started with Microsoft Partner Network
2. An Introduction of Microsoft's cloud (Azure, Teams, Dynamics)
3. Getting the most out of the partnership - tips and tricks
4. Useful links (Standard Agreements, MPN Portal, Media Kit and logos)
